# simpledns-opnsense-plugin
OPNsense plugin of simpledns

I have a dns server called [simpledns](https://github.com/jmeaster30/simpledns) and I want to use it with my OPNsense router!

### Submodules

Because I don't want to fully pull in code for a few things we use some submodules:

- [opnsense-tools](https://github.com/opnsense/tools)
  - This is a set of tools for packaging the plugin
- [simpledns](https://github.com/jmeaster30/simpledns)
  - This is the DNS server code :^)
